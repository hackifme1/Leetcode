/* Problem Statement :

In MATLAB, there is a handy function called reshape which can reshape an m x n matrix into a new one with a different size r x c keeping its original data.

You are given an m x n matrix mat and two integers r and c representing the row number and column number of the wanted reshaped matrix.

The reshaped matrix should be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.

If the reshape operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.


Example 1:

Input: mat = [[1,2],[3,4]], r = 1, c = 4
Output: [[1,2,3,4]]

Example 2:

Input: mat = [[1,2],[3,4]], r = 2, c = 4
Output: [[1,2],[3,4]]
 

Constraints:

m == mat.length
n == mat[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 100
-1000 <= mat[i][j] <= 1000
1 <= r, c <= 300

Cpp code :

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> matrixReshape(vector<vector<int>>& nums, int r, int c) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int m = nums[0].size();
        
        if (n * m != r * c) 
            return nums;
        
        vector<vector<int>> res(r, vector<int>(c, 0));
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++)
            {
                int t = i * m + j;
                res[t / c][t % c] = nums[i][j];
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
};
